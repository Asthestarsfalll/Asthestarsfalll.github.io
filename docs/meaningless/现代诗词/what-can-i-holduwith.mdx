## 博尔赫斯

我给你瘦落的街道
绝望的落日
荒郊的月亮
我给你一个久久地望着孤月的人的悲哀

我给你我已死去的祖辈
后人们用大理石祭奠的先魂
我父亲的父亲
阵亡于布宜诺斯艾利斯的边境
两颗子弹射穿了他的胸膛
死的时候蓄着胡子
尸体被士兵们用牛皮裹起
我母亲的祖父
那年才二十四岁
在秘鲁率领三百人冲锋
如今都成了消失的马背上的亡魂

我给你我的书中所能蕴含的一切悟力
以及我生活中所能有的男子气概和幽默
我给你一个从未有过信仰的人的忠诚

我给你我设法保全的我自己的核心
不营字造句，不和梦交易
不被时间、欢乐和逆境触动的核心。

我给你早在你出生前多年的一个傍晚看到的一朵黄玫瑰的记忆
我给你关于你生命的诠释
关于你自己的理论
你的真实而惊人的存在

我给你我的寂寞
我的黑暗
我心的饥渴
我试图用困惑、危险、失败来打动你

## Borges

I offer you lean streets, 
desperate sunsets, 
the moon of the jagged suburbs.
I offer you the bitterness of a man who has looked long and long at the lonely moon.

I offer you my ancestors, my dead men,
the ghosts that living men have honoured in marble: 
my father's father 
killed in the frontier of Buenos Aires, 
two bullets through his lungs,
bearded and dead, 
wrapped by his soldiers in the hide of a cow; 
my mother's grandfather -just twentyfour 
heading a charge of three hundred men in Perú,
now ghosts on vanished horses.

I offer you whatever insight my books may hold. 
whatever manliness or humour my life.
I offer you the loyalty of a man who has never been loyal. 

I offer you that kernel of myself that I have saved somehow the central heart 
that deals not in words, traffics not with dreams 
and is untouched by time, by joy, by adversities. 

I offer you the memory of a yellow rose seen at sunset, years before you were born. 
I offer you explanationsof yourself, 
theories about yourself, 
authentic and surprising news of yourself.

I can give you my loneliness, 
my darkness, 
the hunger of my heart; 
I am trying to bribe you with uncertainty, with danger, with defeat.
