## 小作文

:::tip

常考的类型有邀请信（描述一个活动）、建议信、推荐信（描述一个事物的优点）、告示和道歉信，此外还有投诉信、辞职信、祝贺信、感谢信和告知信；只要有沾边的这些模板可以混用，如在邀请信中可以描述活动的优点，因此可以套用推荐信的句子。

除了文体，小作文几乎不会对其他内容进行限定，因此小作文主打一个 **编**。

:::

### 书信格式

**称呼**，可以分为以下几种，结尾使用逗号

1. 写给机构，$\text{Dear Sir or Madam,}$
2. 写给个人，题目有人名直接抄，没有自己编，$\text{Dear LiMing,}\ \text{Dear Dr./Prof. Sam,}$
3. 写给集体，$\text{Dear Organizing Committee,}\ \text{Dear Volunteer Association,}$

**正文**，一般分为三段：

1. 自我介绍 + 写作目的一句
2. 四到五句具体内容
3. 希望接受 + 期待回复两句

**落款**，右下角 **左对齐**，结尾逗号

1. 写给组织团体或不熟悉的人，$\text{Yours sincerely/faithfully,}$
2. 写给长者或尊敬的人，$\text{Yours respectfully,}$
3. 写给亲属或挚友，$\text{Yours affectionately,}$

### 自我介绍 + 写作目的

模板为 $\text{As xxxxxx who xxxxxx, I am writing this letter/email to do sth}$，如 $\text{As a students of our university},\text{As a student who is addicted to reading}$.

$\text{to do sth}$ 根据书信类型而定，如邀请信

$$
\begin{aligned}

&\text{As the president of the Students' Union,}\\
&\text{I am writing this email to invite you to organize a professionl team for the "Hope" innovation competition.}
\end{aligned}
$$

加上定语从句：

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\text{As the president of the Students' Union \color{red} who is filled with respect for your academic level \color{normal}, }\\
&\text{I am writing this email to invite you to organize a professionl team for the "Hope" innovation competition.}
\end{aligned}
$$

同样的末尾也可以加上定语从句来修饰要做的事情。 :

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\text{As the president of the Students' Union \color{red} who is filled with respect for your academic level \color{normal}, }\\
&\text{I am writing this email to invite you to organize a professionl team for the "Hope" innovation competition}\\
&\text{\color{red}that enjoys a great reputation all over the world.}
\end{aligned}
$$

但是这样有点太长了，自己取舍。

如果写作对象是朋友等熟人，则像上面的介绍这样自己的身份，而是可以使用定于从句修饰自身的特点/资格，来给后面要做的事情赋予合理性。  比如要给朋友推荐电影，可以写

$$
\text{As one who is addicted to films, I am writing this email to remand you some awsome films that I watched more than 3 times.}
$$

### Smail bar

常见的词组如下

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\text{shorten the distance between students}\\
&\text{make the campus life more colorful/vibrant}\\
&\text{improve their confidence/creativity/physical conditon}\\
&\text{liberate their imagination}\\
&\text{enrich their campus life}\\
&\text{broaden their horizons}\\
&\text{arouse their interests/enthusiasm for}\\
&\text{relieve their pressure}\\
\end{aligned}
$$

简记首字母 $\text{Smile bar}$，开头的动词、中间的名词，结尾的形容词都可以替换成更高级的。

大作文中词组如下：

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\text{save money/time/labor}\\
&\text{make sth/sb more adj}\\
&\text{make our own contribution to xxx}\\
&\text{make positive attributions to things}\\
&\text{imporve competitiveness/efficiency/cultural confidence/nation cohension/living standards/concentration}\\
&\text{lower consumption of resources}\\
&\text{leave a good impression on others}\\
&\text{learn more things}\\
&\text{enrich our spiritual life}\\
&\text{build a good social atmosphere/harmonious society}\\
&\text{broaden out horizons}\\
&\text{bring convenience/warmth to our life}\\
&\text{acquire a better prospect both in career and life}\\
&\text{acquire support and trust from others}\\
&\text{acquire more advanced knowledge}\\
&\text{reduce CO2 emissions}\\
&\text{realize dreams/xxx}\\
&\text{recover from the adversity swiftly}\\
\end{aligned}
$$

### 末段

主要内容表示希望接受和期待回复，相关词组如 $\text{invitation, suggestion, recommendation, apology, congratulation}$.

模板为

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\text{I will be grateful/It will be appreciated if you can accept/take ... into consideration.}\\
&\text{I am looking forward to your early reply.}
\end{aligned}
$$

有些情况使用下面的表达更好，比如道歉信。

$$
\text{I really want you to accept ....}
$$

### 邀请信

正文第二段活动三句话 + 被邀请人一句话，四选三即可。

**第一句**：活动的信息，如举办时间、地点、举办方等。

:::tip 时间地点顺序问题

汉语的表述中，时间在地点之前，如 *我周五晚上 1*0 点在小树林等你，这里有两个时间，周五晚上和十点，因此顺序应该是大时间、小时间、地点。

而在英语中是完全相反，地点、小时间、大时间。

:::

模板如下：

$$
\text{\color{red} what activiy \color{nomal} will be held by \color{green} who \color{yellow} where \color{blue} at time \color{purple} on day}
$$

一般题目都没有时间细节，需要自己补充，如 $\text{7 a.m. on May 1th}$

地点的选择有：

1. 室内，如在礼堂、体育馆 $\text{at the \color{red} auditorium/gym}$
2. 室外，在操场 $\text{on the \color{red}playground}$
3. 校外，在遥远的村庄、福利院、志愿者中心 $\text{in a remote \color{red}village/welfare house/volunteer center}$
4. 线上，在钉钉、腾讯会议、直播平台 $\text{at \color{red} Ding Talk/Tencent Meeting}, \text{on a \color{red}live streaming platform}$

**第二句**：表达活动的目的

$$
\text{It aims to do A, to do B and to do C}
$$

使用前面的短语填空就行了。

句式也可以换成其他的，如

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\text{The main/primary purpose/objective/aim/goal of this activity/event/gathering is to do}\\
&\text{The activity is intended/aims/ to do}\\
\end{aligned}
$$

**第三句**：活动流程和内容

$$
\text{It includes a variety of activities, such as \color{red}A, B and C}
$$

可以填开幕、颁奖、问答、致辞和晚宴等：

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\text{the opening session}\\
&\text{the awarding part}\\
&\text{the question and answering part}\\
&\text{the speech-delivering part}\\
&\text{the dinner part}\\
\end{aligned}
$$

**第四句**：邀请原因

对长辈：$\text{You have enjoyed  great popularity in our university, so your coming will be our great honor}$，ChatGPT 生成的：$\text{Your esteemed reputation precedes you, and it is an immense honor for us to welcome your presence to our school.}$

对平辈：$\text{This is especially for you, so you will enjoy a good time then.}$

### 建议信

:::tip

建议信分为单纯建议信和混合建议信，后者为建议信和其他类型的混合，如建议加祝贺、建议加感谢等，单纯建议信更难。

:::

第一段和其他类型的有一些区别，同样分为两种，单纯建议信：

$$
\text{to make some useful suggestions about}
$$

混合建议信，第一段解决第一个点，如题目要求

1. thank him;
2. give your advice.

则第一段介绍之后写作目的完成第一个要求感谢，如

$$
\text{As one who majors in translation, I am weiting this letter to express my sincere gratitude to you for your congratulations.}
$$

**第一句话**：总论，用于引出下文的建议，如果是单纯建议信则不需要。

$$
\text{Here are some useful suggestions about }
$$

**建议 1**：

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\text{First and foremost/To begin with/Primrily, it is necessary for xxx to do sth.}\\
&\text{First and foremost/To begin with/Primrily, it will be more beneficial for xxx to do sth if xxxxxxx}
\end{aligned}
$$

**建议 2**：

$$
\text{In addition/Besides/Moreover, xxx \color{red} should/ought to/be supposed to \color{normal} do sth.}
$$

**建议 3**：

$$
\text{Last but not least/in closing/Last of all, sth should be done.}
$$

**三大从句**

若三个建议的句子太短，可以再上三大从句（结果/目的/原因，难度从低到高）：

1. 结果，$\text{which would be beneficial to sb.}$
2. 目的，$\text{so that you can/are able to do A, B and C.}$
3. 原因，$\text{because …}$

### 推荐信

需要积累相关的电影、书籍等，以防到时候没得写。

Subject: 🏠 Excited to Share an Apartment with You, John! 🌍

Dear John,

I hope this email finds you in good health and high spirits. I am delighted to inform you that we will be sharing an apartment as we embark on our study abroad journey together. Before we embark on this exciting endeavor, I would like to take the opportunity to introduce myself and discuss our living habits. Moreover, I would greatly appreciate any advice you might have on navigating the local living experience.

Firstly, allow me to share some insight into my living habits:

1. 🌙 I consider myself a nocturnal individual, deriving the most productivity during the evening hours. However, I am adaptable and open to finding a mutually beneficial routine that accommodates both our preferences.
2.  🎧 I have a fondness for listening to music as it aids in my focus and relaxation. Rest assured, I will always utilize headphones to ensure you are not disturbed. If you have any specific preferences or concerns regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to inform me.
3.  🧹 I strongly believe in maintaining a clean and organized living space. I understand the importance of shared responsibilities and would be more than willing to discuss and establish a cleaning schedule that suits both our needs.

On to my second point, being a local student, your expertise and insights about the area would be immensely valuable to me. I kindly request your advice on various aspects of living in our new abode. This may include recommendations for local dining establishments, cultural customs, transportation tips, or any other information you deem beneficial for a newcomer to the city. Your guidance and local knowledge will undoubtedly contribute to making my transition more seamless and enjoyable.

John, I am eagerly looking forward to meeting you and embarking on this incredible adventure together. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions, concerns, or if there are further matters you would like to discuss.

Wishing you a splendid day!

Best regards,

[Your Name]

\text{The caption indicates .... / Simple as the picture is, the symbolic meaning is as deep as ocean.}
